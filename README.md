Hi, I'm Amin Mortezaie! ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŽ“ With a bachelor's degree in computer engineering from Iran University of Science and Technology, I am a passionate and driven Blockchain Engineer at Abantether, a leading company in the decentralized finance field.

ðŸ’» At Abantether, I've played a key role in developing a robust financial system, showcasing my expertise in programming, problem-solving, and blockchain integration. I successfully introduced a pivotal feature in the "Personal Wallet" project, attracting over 1 million users with 20,000 daily active users. My contributions include designing and implementing an efficient database structure using Redis, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL, as well as managing numerous wallets and transactions across different networks.

ðŸš€ Beyond my work at Abantether, I'm a lifelong learner and tech enthusiast. I've engaged in a Cosmos SDK internship course, delved into research on various white papers, and explored consensus protocols such as Helium, VeChain, Origin Trail, and Stratum. Additionally, I designed a Tokenomics system for Drybit, implemented a blockchain PoW system using Golang, and created a microservice system for FIX using Message Queues.

ðŸŒŸ I am confident in my ability to tackle new challenges and collaborate on complex projects. Motivated by my passion for blockchain and the desire to make a positive impact, I look forward to continuous skill development and contributing meaningfully to the field.
